# Changelog

All notable changes to `danielgnh/statamic-mcp` are documented here. The format
follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). The package is pre-1.0:
until `v1.0.0`, breaking changes may land in minor (`0.x`) releases and are
called out here explicitly.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `php please mcp:keys` — one-command key provisioning for production. Ensures a
  stable Passport key pair exists (generating one only when none exists — never
  overwriting, since regeneration silently invalidates every connected client) and
  prints it as paste-ready `PASSPORT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `PASSPORT_PUBLIC_KEY` env
  variables, escaping done. `--json` pipes into secret-store CLIs, `--write` fills
  the local `.env`. Source precedence mirrors Passport's runtime: configured env
  keys first (warning when stale key files differ), then key files, then generate.
  `mcp:setup`, `mcp:doctor`, and the endpoint's 503 remedy all point at it.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- The OAuth consent screen and the MCP Tokens utility are rebuilt on shared
  addon Blade components (`auth-card`, `avatar`, `button`, `heading`,
  `description`), with a deterministic per-user avatar gradient. Visual only —
  no behavior change.
- `config/mcp.php` inline comments trimmed; no keys changed.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **OAuth mode now works with file users — no user migration, ever.** The addon
  registers its own auth guard: bearers are validated by Passport's ResourceServer
  (signature, expiry, revocation — identical checks to Passport's stock guard) and
  the token's user resolves through the Statamic repository. No Eloquent users, no
  `HasApiTokens` trait, no `api` guard in `config/auth.php`. Passport still needs a
  database for its *own* tables; the addon ships a migration converting their
  bigint `user_id` columns to string(36) so Statamic's UUID ids fit (loaded only in
  OAuth mode; safe for integer ids — this also fixes the latent insert crash for
  UUID-keyed Eloquent users on the old path). Keys can come from
  `PASSPORT_PRIVATE_KEY` / `PASSPORT_PUBLIC_KEY` env vars — the deploy-friendly
  path `mcp:doctor` now recognizes.

### Changed

- `laravel/passport` requirement bumped to `^13.0`.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- OAuth bearers must carry the `mcp:use` scope `laravel/mcp` advertises — a
  Passport token minted for the host app's own API can no longer double as an
  MCP entry point (403 `insufficient_scope` instead).
- `blueprints_get` is gated on the same per-resource view/edit permission the
  content read tools use, so schema no longer leaks to users who can't view the
  content.
- `globals_get` no longer 500s on a set configured for a site but never saved
  there (null localization guarded on both the single and listing paths).
- Out-of-range dates in `entries_create` / `entries_update` surface as a clean
  tool error instead of a 500.

### Changed

- Internal refactors: rich-text preview logic extracted into a shared concern;
  comments that restated the code trimmed.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-13

Initial release.

### Added

- Remote (streamable-HTTP) MCP server for Statamic v6, built on `laravel/mcp`,
  mounted at `mcp/statamic` (configurable).
- 19 tools: `statamic_overview`, `blueprints_get`,
  `entries_list` / `entries_get` / `entries_create` / `entries_update` / `entries_delete`,
  `terms_list` / `terms_get` / `terms_create` / `terms_update` / `terms_delete`,
  `globals_get`, `globals_update`, and the assets tools below. Delete tools are
  only registered under `'deletes' => true`; under `read_only` only the read
  tools appear. `tools/list` returns the full tool set in one page (the default
  15-per-page cut-off would hide tools from clients that never paginate).
- Assets tools: `assets_list`, `assets_get`, `assets_upload`, `assets_update`,
  and `assets_delete`. Uploads accept a `source_url` — downloaded server-side
  behind a fail-closed SSRF guard (public hosts only, DNS pinning, per-hop
  redirect revalidation, streaming size cap) — or inline `content_base64`;
  collisions are refused, never overwritten. `assets_update` merges
  blueprint-validated metadata and passes the CP's `focus` key through for
  lossless round-trips. Exposure via the `resources.asset_containers` config
  key and an `uploads` config block (`max_size` in KB, `source_allowlist`);
  `statamic_overview` lists exposed containers with `can_upload` / `can_edit` /
  `can_delete` flags.
- Token auth mode (default): `mcp_{tokenId}_{secret}` tokens hashed (SHA-256)
  into `storage/statamic/mcp/tokens.yaml` — works on file-based and Eloquent
  user installs. Commands: `mcp:token`, `mcp:tokens`, `mcp:token:revoke`.
  Every authentication failure answers one indistinguishable 401 — including
  hand-edited records that lost their hash key (which always reject, never
  degrading to a guessable password). Token-store writes are serialized behind
  an atomic lock, making concurrent CLI + CP issuance/revocation safe.
- OAuth auth mode (opt-in): delegates entirely to `laravel/mcp` + Laravel
  Passport; misconfiguration answers 503 with the exact remedy on the MCP
  route only — token mode never touches Passport.
- `php please mcp:setup` — interactive onboarding wizard for both auth modes. The
  OAuth path checks, confirms, and applies every prerequisite (Passport install,
  encryption keys, `.env` flip, migrations) and verifies with `mcp:doctor`. File
  edits are anchor-based with a printed manual fallback; the wizard is idempotent.
- `php please mcp:doctor` configuration health check with remedies, covering
  both auth modes and the "enabled but failed to mount" state.
- MCP Tokens utility in the Control Panel (Tools → Utilities, retitled **MCP
  Access**) — issue and revoke your own tokens, gated by the "Access MCP Tokens
  utility" permission; super admins see all tokens. Built on Statamic v6's UI
  component kit (native CP look including dark mode, copy-to-clipboard on the
  one-time token reveal, toast notifications). User-controlled strings render
  inertly (`v-pre`) so token names can't execute as Vue expressions. Includes
  an OAuth connections panel: one row per connected user + client pair from
  Passport's tables, with an Active/Expired status that honestly counts live
  refresh tokens and a Disconnect action revoking the pair's access *and*
  refresh tokens.
- Authorization via Statamic's native permission system on every call — one
  addon permission (`access mcp`), then the connected user's regular
  collection/taxonomy/global/site permissions decide everything else. Writes
  save drafts by default; any publish-state transition is gated on the
  publish permission; revision-enabled collections stage working copies
  instead of touching live entries (publish from the Control Panel).
- Raw-data write model: writes accept raw field data validated against the
  blueprint (CP-parity validation replacements), never augmented output.
  Long Bard/rich-text values are truncated to preview objects on read and
  rejected if round-tripped into a write.
- Origin-cascade entry deletes with per-localization site gating and full
  enumeration of what was removed; term deletes update entry references
  (single and multi-term fields) like the CP does.
- Config: kill switch, route, auth mode, extra middleware (default
  `throttle:60,1`), `read_only`, `deletes` (off by default), per-type
  resource exposure allowlists, `per_page`.
- CI runs the suite twice: the main leg and a leg with `laravel/passport`
  installed, activating the OAuth-connection tests that skip in the main leg.

### Known caveats

- `laravel/mcp` is required at `^0.8` — a pre-1.0 release line. Its API may
  change in 0.x minors; this addon pins `^0.8` and will track upstream in
  its own minor releases.
- Under multisite, the default site is never gated by `access {site} site`
  (documented in the README's security model; CP-parity review is a future
  candidate).
- Deleting an entry from a revision-enabled collection leaves its revision
  and working-copy files on disk as orphans — the Control Panel behaves the
  same way.
